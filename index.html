          <p>
            I am a front-end developer with 2 years of experience, passionate about creating intuitive and responsive user interfaces. <br/>
            I have built interactive dashboards and client-facing applications that balance performance with aesthetic appeal. <br/>
            With a strong eye for detail and usability, I enjoy transforming complex requirements into clean, user-friendly designs that engage and delight end users.
